                    <li><strong>Too Expensive (32%, +3pp)</strong>: The slight increase suggests a growing perception of Abu Dhabi as a premium destination. Marketing should highlight value propositions and competitive pricing compared to other luxury destinations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Much to Do (31%, +7pp)</strong>: The increase suggests a lack of awareness about Abu Dhabi's diverse offerings. Marketing should showcase the variety of activities and experiences available.</li>
